# siloTwitter
A self contained Twitter like app.  It has no connection to Twitter or any other public services.  

TODO: 
 - fix login screen for when keyboard pops up.  Turn it into a scroll view of some sort to move the fields up above the keyboard
- make error handling more centralized.  Currently, all codes and strings are hard coded.  Using a manager of some sort will fix that.
